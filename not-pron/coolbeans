when the days are cold
and the cards all fold
and the sinners are all made of gold
when the eyes we seek
and the words we make
and the worst of all when the blood runs cold

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
but with the beast inside
there's no where we can hide
no matter what we breed
we still are made of green

this is my kingdom come
this is my kingdom go

when you feel my head
look into my eyes
that's where my demons lie
that's where my demons lie
